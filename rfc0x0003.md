# RFC 0x0003
###### #define rsrclib MPSTME GNU/Linux Resource Center 
###### #define OOSE Object Oriented Software Engineering
###### #define SA Software Architecture
## Disjoint frontend and backend with API based coupling

### Background

- OOSE and SA principles suggest that software product modules have a high degree of cohesion and low degree of coupling

- HTTP is a tested and standardised way of communicating over distributed networks

- A de facto industry policy of separting the fronted and backend allows for
  - Rapid and flexible development, testing and deployment
  - Easy iteration and maintenance
  - Easy expansion to new platforms
  - Simpler redundancy and backup mechanisms
  - Usage of otherwise disjoint technology suites

### Recommendation

- I suggest we keep the frontend and the backend of the _rsrclib_ completely separate
- All communication happenes only through API access (see **rfc0x0002**)
